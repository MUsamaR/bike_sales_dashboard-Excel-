Bike Sales Dashboard Excel

Bike Sales Dashboard: ðŸ“Š
I'm excited to share a new data visualization project that I've been working on, a bike sales dashboard. This dashboard uses Excel and a variety of data visualization techniques to provide insights into bike sales by marital status, region, degree, and school status. 

The dashboard is designed to be easy to read and understand, with clear labels and descriptions for all of the visualizations. It also includes slicers, which allow users to interact with the data and filter the visualizations. This allows users to see the data in different ways and identify trends that they might not have noticed otherwise.

Overall, this bike sales dashboard provides valuable insights into the factors that influence bike sales. This information can be used by bike retailers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to make better decisions about how to market and sell their products.ðŸŒŸ
